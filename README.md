# Token Swapping in DeFi Applications Course

This module transitions from foundational DeFi concepts and secure ERC-20 token handling to practical implementation of token swapping functionality. Learners will explore how to integrate with [0x Swap API](https://0x.org/docs/0x-swap-api/introduction) for token swapping.

By the end of this course, learners will have built a simple frontend interface for token swapping using:

- [0x Swap API](https://0x.org/docs/0x-swap-api/introduction)
- [Next.js App Route](https://nextjs.org/)
- [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction)
