- Add other chains
  - add new changes in providers.tsx for rainbowkit ConnectButton
- Show the percentage breakdown where a swap was sourced from using the `sources` [response param](https://0x.org/docs/0x-swap-api/api-references/get-swap-v1-quote#response) (ex: the best price comes from 50% Uniswap, 50% Kyber)
- Currently we set the token allowance is set to the max amount. Change this to be safer so the user only approves just the amount needed.
- Calculate price when a user enters new “to” token (right now it only auto-calculates when a user enters a new "from" token)
- Show estimated gas in $
- Filter down the long tokens list
- Allows users to switch chains and receive a proper quote (remember the tokenlist will change as well!)
- Use 0x Swap API as part of a multi-step action (e.g. swap + cross-chain, swap in smart contract)
- Enable buys
- Don't allow users to select the same sell/buyTokens
